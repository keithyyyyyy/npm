uses of Node Package Manager:
    1. use our code in other projects
    2. use code written by other devs
    3. share our own solutions with other devs

a package is essentially a folder that contains javascript code

use NPM package locally:
    can only be used in the project you load the package to
    "npm i <packageName>"

use NPM package globally:
    can be used in any project
    "npm install -g <packageName>"
    "sudo npm install -g <packageName>" (mac)
    theres less need for global because of NPX

package.json:
    manifest file that stores important info about the project/package
    its stored as a dependency
    3 ways to create package.json:
        1. manual approach (create package.json in root, create properties etc)
        2. npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
            a. package name
            b. version
            c. description
            d. entry point
            e. test command
            f. git repository
            g. key words
            h. author
            i. license
        3. npm init -y (everything setup as default cause of the -y)
